This is an example of how we can automatically update Windows Defender Antimalware (for example during Autopilot enrollment).

An option to deploy the scripts is to wrap them as a win32 app and deploy the package with Microsoft Intune (during Autopilot enrollment).

The logs are saved on %programdata%\Microsoft\IntuneManagementExtension\Logs. This makes it available in the Device Diagnostics for Intune.
